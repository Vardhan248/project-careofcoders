                <h3>Multithreading</h3>
                <p>
                   
                    In Java, Multithreading refers to a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum utilization of the CPU. A thread in Java is a lightweight process requiring fewer resources to create and share the process resources. <br><br>
                    Multithreading and Multiprocessing are used for multitasking in Java, but we prefer multithreading over multiprocessing. This is because the threads use a shared memory area which helps to save memory, and also, the content-switching between the threads is a bit faster than the process. <br><br>

                    Life Cycle of a Thread : <br>
                    There are five states a thread has to go through in its life cycle. This life cycle is controlled by JVM (Java Virtual Machine). These states are:<br><br>
                    
                    New<br>
                    Runnable<br>
                    Running<br>
                    Non-Runnable (Blocked)<br>
                    Terminated<br><br>


                    1. New <br>

                    In this state, a new thread begins its life cycle. This is also called a born thread. The thread is in the new state if you create an instance of Thread class but before the invocation of the start() method.<br><br>
                    
                    2. Runnable<br>
                    
                    A thread becomes runnable after a newly born thread is started. In this state, a thread would be executing its task.<br><br>
                    
                    3. Running<br>
                    
                    When the thread scheduler selects the thread then, that thread would be in a running state.<br><br>
                    
                    4. Non-Runnable (Blocked)<br>
                    
                    The thread is still alive in this state, but currently, it is not eligible to run.<br><br>
                    
                    5. Terminated<br>
                    
                    A thread is terminated due to the following reasons:<br><br>
                    
                    • Either its run() method exists normally, i.e., the thread’s code has executed the program. <br>
                    • Or due to some unusual errors like segmentation fault or an unhandled exception. <br><br>
                    A thread that is in a terminated state does not consume ant cycle of the CPU. <br><br>


                    Java Thread Methods <br>
                    These are the methods that are available in the Thread class:<br><br>
                    
                    1. public void start()<br>
                    
                    It starts the execution of the thread and then calls the run() on this Thread object.<br><br>

                    2. public void run() <br>

                    This thread is used to do an action for a thread. The run() method is instantiated if the thread was constructed using a separate Runnable object. <br><br>

                    3. public static void sleep() <br>

                    This blocks the currently running thread for the specified amount of time. <br><br>

                    4. public static Thread currentThread() <br>

                    It returns a reference to the currently running thread. <br><br>

                    5. public void join() <br>

                    It causes the current thread to block until the second thread terminates or the specified amount of milliseconds passes. <br><br>

                    6. public final int getPriority() <br>

                    It is used to check the priority of the thread. When a thread is created, some priority is assigned to it. This priority is assigned either by the JVM or by the programmer explicitly while creating the thread. <br><br>

                    7. public final void setPriority() <br>

                    This method is used to change the priority of the thread. The priority of every thread is represented by the integer number from 1 to 10. The default priority of a thread is 5. <br><br>

                    And many more....... <br><br>

                <h3>Synchronization</h3>
                <p> 
                    Synchronization in Java <br>
                    Synchronization in Java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.<br>
                    
                    Java Synchronization is better option where we want to allow only one thread to access the shared resource.<br><br>                    
                    Why use Synchronization?<br>
                    The synchronization is mainly used to<br>
                    
                    To prevent thread interference. <br>
                    To prevent consistency problem. <br><br>
                    Types of Synchronization <br>
                    There are two types of synchronization <br>  
                
                    Process Synchronization<br>
Thread Synchronization<br>
Here, we will discuss only thread synchronization.<br><br>

Thread Synchronization<br>
There are two types of thread synchronization mutual exclusive and inter-thread communication.<br><br>

Mutual Exclusive<br>
Synchronized method.<br>
Synchronized block.<br><br>
Static synchronization.<br>
Cooperation (Inter-thread communication in java)<br><br>
Mutual Exclusive<br>
Mutual Exclusive helps keep threads from interfering with one another while sharing data. It can be achieved by using the following three ways:<br>

By Using Synchronized Method<br>
By Using Synchronized Block<br>
By Using Static Synchronization<br><br>
Concept of Lock in Java<br>
Synchronization is built around an internal entity known as the lock or monitor. Every object has a lock associated with it. By convention, a thread that needs consistent access to an object's fields has to acquire the object's lock before accessing them, and then release the lock when it's done with them.<br>

From Java 5 the package java.util.concurrent.locks contains several lock implementations.<br><br>

Java Synchronized Method<br>
If you declare any method as synchronized, it is known as synchronized method.<br>

Synchronized method is used to lock an object for any shared resource.<br>

When a thread invokes a synchronized method, it automatically acquires the lock for that object and releases it when the thread completes its task.<br><br><br>
