    <h3>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN C VS C++</h3>
    <p> 
        Key Differences Between C Vs C++<br><br>
Enlisted below are th main differences between C Vs C++.<br>
1) Type of Programming:<br>
C is a procedural language in which the program revolves around the functions. The entire problem is broken down into numerous functions. The main focus of the program is on functions or procedures to get the things done.<br>
C++, on the contrary, is an object-oriented programming language. Here the data of the problem is the main focus and the classes are built around this data. Functions operate on the data and closely bound to data.<br><br>
2) Programming Approach:<br>
As C is a procedural language, it follows a top-down approach of programming. Here we take the problem and then break it into subproblems until we find single subproblems that can be solved directly. Then we combine the solutions to get the main solution.<br>
C++ follows a bottom-up approach to programming. In this, we start with low-level design or coding and then build on this low-level design to get a high-level solution.<br><br>
3) Application Development:<br>
C language is helpful in the programming of embedded systems or low-level implementations.<br>
C++, on the other hand, is more suitable for server-side applications, network applications or for applications like gaming, etc.<br><br>
4) File Extension:<br>
The programs written in C are usually saved with “.c” extension while the C++ programs are saved with the “.cpp” extension.<br><br>
5) Compatibility With Each Other:<br>
C++ is a subset of C as it is developed and takes most of its procedural constructs from the C language. Thus any C program will compile and run fine with the C++ compiler.<br>
However, C language does not support object-oriented features of C++ and hence it is not compatible with C++ programs. Therefore programs written in C++ will not run on C compilers.<br>
6) Compatibility With Other Languages:<br>
C++ language is generally compatible with other generic programming languages but C language is not.<br><br>
7) Ease of Coding:<br>
We can say that C is a hands-on language and we can program it in whichever way we want. C++ consists of some high-level object-oriented programming constructs that help us to code high-level programs.<br>
Thus if we say C is easy then C++ is also easier to code.<br><br>
8) Data Security:<br>
In C, the main emphasis is on functions or procedures rather than on data. Hence as far as data security is concerned, it is negligible in C.<br>
In C++, as we are dealing with classes and objects, the main building block of the program is Data. Thus, data is tightly secured using classes, access specifiers, encapsulation, etc.<br><br>
9) Program Division:<br>
A program in C is divided into functions and modules. These functions and modules are then called by the main function or other functions for execution.<br>
A C++ program is divided into classes and objects. The problem is designed into classes and the objects of these classes are the executing units that are created by the main functions and are executed.<br><br>
10) Standard I/O Operations:<br>
The standard input-output operations in C to read/write data from/to the standard device are ‘scanf’ and ‘printf’ respectively.<br>
In C++, the data is read from the standard input device using ‘cin’ while it is printed to the output device using ‘cout’.<br><br>
11) Focus/Emphasis:<br>
Being a procedural language, C has more emphasis on the sequence of steps or procedures to solve a problem.<br>
C++, on the other hand, is object-oriented and thus puts more focus on objects and classes around which the solution is to be built.<br><br>
12) The main() Function:<br>
In C++ we cannot call a main() function from any other point. The main() function is the single execution point.<br>
However, in C language, we can have a main() function called by the other functions in the code.<br><br>
13) Variable:<br>
Variables need to be declared at the beginning of the function block in C, on the contrary, we can declare variables anywhere in a C++ program provided they are declared before they are used in the code.<br><br>
14) Global Variables:<br>
C language allows multiple declarations of global variables. C++, however, doesn’t allow multiple declarations of global variables.<br><br>
15) Pointers And Reference Variables:<br>
Pointers are the variables that point to memory addresses. Both C and C++ support pointers and various operations performed on pointers.<br>
References act as aliases for the variables and point to the same memory location as a variable.<br>
C language only supports pointers and not references. C++ supports pointers as well as references.

    <h3>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN C++ AND JAVA:</h3>
    <p> 
        1.Type Of Programming Language <br>
C++ is both a procedural and object-oriented programing language. Hence, C++ has features specific to procedural languages as well as features of object-oriented programming language.<br>
Java is a completely object-oriented programming language.<br><br>
2. Library Interface<br>
C++ allows direct calls to the native system libraries. Hence it is more suited for system-level programming.<br>
Java has no direct call support to its native libraries. We can call the libraries through Java Native Interface or Java Native Access.<br><br>
3. Distinguishing Features<br>
Features related to the procedural languages and object-oriented language are the distinguishing features of C++.<br>
Automatic garbage collection is the distinguishing feature of Java. Meanwhile, Java does not support destructors.<br><br>
4. Type Semantics<br>
As far as type semantics for C++ are concerned, primitive and object types are consistent.<br>
But for Java, there is no consistency between the primitive and object types.<br><br>
5. Input Mechanism<br>
C++ uses cin and cout along with ‘>>’ and ‘<<’ operators respectively to read in and write the data.<br>
In java, the System class is used for input-output. To read the input, System.in which reads one byte at a time is used. The construct System.out is used to write the output.<br><br>
6. Access Control And Object Protection<br>
C++ has a flexible model for objects with access specifiers controlling the access and strong encapsulation ensuring protection.<br>
Java has a comparatively cumbersome object model with weak encapsulation.<br><br>
7. Goto Statement<br>
C++ supports the goto statement, but its use should be minimized in order to prevent the consequences of using it in a program.<br>
Java does not provide support for the goto statement.<br><br>
8. Scope Resolution Operator<br>
Scope resolution operator is used to access the global variables and define methods outside the class.<br>
C++ supports scope resolution operator as it uses it to access global variables. It also allows us to define functions outside the class and access them using the scope resolution operator.<br>
In contrast, Java doesn’t support the scope resolution operator. Java also doesn’t allow defining the functions outside. Everything related to the program including the main function needs to be inside a class.<br><br>
9. Try/Catch Block<br>
In C++, we can exclude the try/catch block even if we know that the code might throw an exception.<br>
However, in Java, if we are sure that the code will throw an exception, then we must include this code under the try/catch block. Exceptions are different in Java as it doesn’t support destructors.<br><br>
10. Runtime Error Detection<br>
In C++ the runtime error detection is the programmer’s responsibility.<br>
In Java, the runtime error detection is controlled by the system.<br><br>
11. Language Support<br>
Because of its proximity to hardware, and libraries that allow accessing system resources, C++ is more suitable for system programming although we have a wide range of applications including database, enterprise, gaming, etc. developed in C++.<br><br>
12. Data And Functions<br>
C++ has a global scope as well as namespace scope. Thus data and functions can exist outside the class as well.<br>
In Java, all data and functions need to be in the class. There is no global scope, however, there can be package scope.<br><br>
13. Structures & Unions<br>
Structures and Unions are data structures that can have members with different data types. C++ supports both structures and unions.<br>
Java, however, does not support structures or unions.<br><br>
14. Object Management<br>
In C++ objects are managed manually. The creation and destruction of objects are carried out manually using the new and delete operators respectively. We also use constructors and destructors for class objects.<br>
Java does not support destructors though it supports constructors. Java is also heavily dependent on automatic garbage collection for collecting and destroying objects.<br><br>
15. Parameter Passing<br>
Pass by Value and pass by reference are the two important parameter passing techniques used in programming. Both Java and C++ supports both these techniques.<br><br>
16. Hardware<br>
C++ is close to hardware and has many libraries that can manipulate the hardware resources. Because of its closeness to hardware, C++ is often used for system programming, gaming applications, operating system, and compilers.
Java is mostly an application development language and is not close to the hardware.
